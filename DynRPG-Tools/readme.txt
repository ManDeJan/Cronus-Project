DynRPG 0.31 Instructions:

1. Patch your RPG_RT.exe using the dynrpg_patcher.exe file. This is the same as 0.20, so if you already patched 0.20, you don't need to do it again. Continue to step 2.

2. Replace your current dynloader.dll with the included one. This has some bugfixes and was unofficially released.

3. Enjoy!

If you are a plugin developer, use the 0.31 source code (05/26/2016) included, or grab the latest from:
