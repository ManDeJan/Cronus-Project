			/*! \brief Moves a character

				This function will move a character (event or hero) the same
				way the "Move event" command does.

				The \c data parameter is a pointer to a \c char array containing
				the encoded data. You can find a list of possible movement
				commands at the RPG::MoveType documentation. For most
				movement commands, you will just use one byte containing the
				move type.

				Example:
				\code
char moves[] = {RPG::MT_MOVE_UP, RPG::MT_MOVE_RIGHT, RPG::MT_MOVE_RIGHT, RPG::MT_TURN_RANDOMLY, RPG::MT_MOVE_FORWARD};
RPG::hero->move(moves, sizeof(moves));
				\endcode

				There are, however, a few commands which take parameters:
				RPG::MT_SWITCH_ON, RPG::MT_SWITCH_OFF, RPG::MT_CHANGE_GRAPHIC
				and RPG::MT_PLAY_SE. If you want to use these commands, you
				better use a \c std::string. You need to add the parameters to
				the string right after the command byte, using the functions
				\ref RPG::encode(int) for numerical parameters and
				\ref RPG::encode(std::string) for string parameters.

				Example:
				\code
std::string moves = "";
moves += (char)RPG::MT_MOVE_UP;
moves += (char)RPG::MT_FACE_DOWN;
moves += (char)RPG::MT_PLAY_SE;
moves += RPG::encode("chicken"); // filename
moves += RPG::encode(100); // volume
moves += RPG::encode(100); // speed
moves += RPG::encode(50); // pan
moves += (char)RPG::MT_WAIT;
moves += (char)RPG::MT_TURN_AROUND;
RPG::hero->move(moves.c_str(), moves.length());
				\endcode
				\param data Pointer to the movement data
				\param length Length of the movement data
				\param repeatPattern \c true if the pattern should be repeated
				until \ref stop is called
				\param ignoreImpossible Should impossible movements be ignored?
				\param frequency Frequency of the movement
				\note RPG::MT_INCREASE_FREQUENCY and RPG::MT_DECREASE_FREQUENCY
				commands will not take permanent effect after the movement
				ended unless the movement was started with the same frequency
				as in the \ref frequency member of the character.
