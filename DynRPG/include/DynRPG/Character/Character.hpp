	/*! \brief Moves a character

		This function will move a character (event or hero) the same
		way the "Move event" command does.

		The \c data parameter is a pointer to a \c char array containing
		the encoded data. You can find a list of possible movement
		commands at the RPG::MoveType documentation. For most
		movement commands, you will just use one byte containing the
		move type.

		Example:
		\code
char moves[] = {RPG::MT_MOVE_UP, RPG::MT_MOVE_RIGHT, RPG::MT_MOVE_RIGHT, RPG::MT_TURN_RANDOMLY, RPG::MT_MOVE_FORWARD};
RPG::hero->move(moves, sizeof(moves));
		\endcode

		There are, however, a few commands which take parameters:
		RPG::MT_SWITCH_ON, RPG::MT_SWITCH_OFF, RPG::MT_CHANGE_GRAPHIC
		and RPG::MT_PLAY_SE. If you want to use these commands, you
		better use a \c std::string. You need to add the parameters to
		the string right after the command byte, using the functions
		\ref RPG::encode(int) for numerical parameters and
		\ref RPG::encode(std::string) for string parameters.

		Example:
		\code
std::string moves = "";
moves += (char)RPG::MT_MOVE_UP;
moves += (char)RPG::MT_FACE_DOWN;
moves += (char)RPG::MT_PLAY_SE;
moves += RPG::encode("chicken"); // filename
moves += RPG::encode(100); // volume
moves += RPG::encode(100); // speed
moves += RPG::encode(50); // pan
moves += (char)RPG::MT_WAIT;
moves += (char)RPG::MT_TURN_AROUND;
RPG::hero->move(moves.c_str(), moves.length());
		\endcode
		\param data Pointer to the movement data
		\param length Length of the movement data
		\param repeatPattern \c true if the pattern should be repeated
		until \ref stop is called
		\param ignoreImpossible Should impossible movements be ignored?
		\param frequency Frequency of the movement
		\note RPG::MT_INCREASE_FREQUENCY and RPG::MT_DECREASE_FREQUENCY
		commands will not take permanent effect after the movement
		ended unless the movement was started with the same frequency
		as in the \ref frequency member of the character.
		\warning This is an experimental function.
