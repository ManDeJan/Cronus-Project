			/*! \brief Condition Resistance Array (See RPG::DamageMultiplier)
				
				If at a certain point, the resistance of a condition and all conditions higher than it are C, the conditions.size will equal the number of the highest non-C condition. 
				
				\b Example: 
				
					Cond1: A
					Cond2: B
					Cond3: C
					Cond4: C
					Cond5: C
					
				Because Cond3 is C, and those above it are C, conditions.size will be 2, because Cond2 is the last non-C condition.
					
				\warning This can be confusing, because if you need to use conditions[15], but check for conditions.size to be 15 first, it could be 10 if 11-15 are all C, so the check would be false. The solution would be to use RPG::conditions.count() for the check instead. This would resize the array once a condition higher than conditions.size is called, but because of the resizeValue in the template for RPG::DArray, conditions 11-15 would be correctly assigned to C
