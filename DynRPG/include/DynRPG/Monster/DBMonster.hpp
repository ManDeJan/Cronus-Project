	/*! \brief Condition Resistance Array (See RPG::DamageMultiplier)

		If at a certain point, the resistance of a condition and all conditions higher than it are C, the conditions.size will equal the number of the highest non-C condition.

		\b Example:

			Cond1: A
			Cond2: B
			Cond3: C
			Cond4: C
			Cond5: C

		Because Cond3 is C, and those above it are C, conditions.size will be 2, because Cond2 is the last non-C condition.

		\warning This can be confusing, because if you need to use conditions[15], but check for conditions.size to be 15 first, it could be 10 if 11-15 are all C, so the check would be false. The solution would be to use RPG::conditions.count() for the check instead. This would resize the array once a condition higher than conditions.size is called, but because of the resizeValue in the template for RPG::DArray, conditions 11-15 would be correctly assigned to C
