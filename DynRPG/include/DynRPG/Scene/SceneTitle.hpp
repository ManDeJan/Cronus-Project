	\warning Most of the parameters can't be used in onInitTitleScreen, because they haven't
		been created yet. Use onFrame instead to catch them when they have.

	Example:
	\code
if (RPG::title->winStartLoadEnd) { // Moves the title screen window to position 0,32.
RPG::title->winStartLoadEnd->x = 0;
RPG::title->winStartLoadEnd->y = 32;
}
