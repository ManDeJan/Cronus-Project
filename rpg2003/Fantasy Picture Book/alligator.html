<P>The alligator has two subspecies: the crocodile and alligator.  The marked difference between the two is the way their mouths are formed.  The alligator has a round mouth structure.  Its teeth are not visible when its mouth is closed.  Conversely, the crocodile has a more angular mouth structure, in which its teeth are visible, even when its mouth is closed.  Also, the crocodile's brain is somewhat larger.  Sometimes people mislabel these two types, as with the alligator that is commonly seen in the Nile river, which is often called a crocodile.</P></FONT></DIV>
