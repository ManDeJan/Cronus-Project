<P>The story of the minotaur appears in Greek myth.  As a punishment by the gods, The king of Crete and his wife had a half-man, half-bull child.  Because they were unable to manage such a child, the king of Crete built a labyrinth and confined the minotaur within it, then proceeded to send a child into the labyrinth each year as a sacrifice.  Eventually, prince Theseus of Athens was able to defeat the minotaur.  In games, minotaurs are usually pictured with large blunt weapons such as clubs and maces, but they also sometimes use axes.</P></FONT></DIV>
